# 7-Segment-Display-Driver-Simulation
This project simulates a 7-segment display driver using Verilog. The DE1 module converts a 4-bit binary input (W, X, Y, Z) into segment outputs (A-G) using OR and AND gates. The TestBench module tests the design by simulating inputs and verifying 7-segment display outputs, highlighting digital logic and hardware simulation concepts.

# Project Files
# DE1 Module:

- Converts a 4-bit binary input (W, X, Y, Z) to outputs (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) that control the 7-segment display.
- Utilizes OR and AND gates to derive the segment signals from the input values.
- Inverts inputs to create internal signals for logical operations.

# TestBench Module:

- Simulates various input combinations to test the DE1 module.
- Displays the segment outputs for each input combination to verify correctness.
- CircuitVerse File
- The CircuitVerse file is an autogenerated netlist code for a 7-segment display driver. It includes the following components:

# Input Inversion:

- Inverts the inputs W, X, Y, and Z to create notW, notX, notY, and notZ.

OR Gates:
- Combines different inputs and their inversions to produce intermediate signals (or_0_out to or_16_out).
  
AND Gates:
- Uses the intermediate OR gate outputs to create the final segment outputs (and_0_out to and_6_out).
  
Output Assignments:
- Assigns the AND gate outputs to the corresponding segments (A to G) of the 7-segment display.
TestBench:
- Initializes inputs and simulates different input combinations.
- Displays the resulting segment outputs to verify the DE1 module's functionality.

# How to Use
# Simulation:

- Use a Verilog simulator like Icarus Verilog at https://www.edaplayground.com/ to run the simulation.
- Load the DE1 and TestBench modules into the simulator.
- Observe the segment outputs for various input combinations to ensure the display driver works correctly.
  
# Testing:

- The TestBench module runs through different binary inputs and prints the segment outputs.
- Compare the displayed outputs with the expected results to verify the correctness.
