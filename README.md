# -7-Segment-Display-Driver-Simulation
This project simulates a 7-segment display driver using Verilog. The DE1 module converts a 4-bit binary input (W, X, Y, Z) into segment outputs (A-G) using OR and AND gates. The TestBench module tests the design by simulating inputs and verifying 7-segment display outputs, highlighting digital logic and hardware simulation concepts.
